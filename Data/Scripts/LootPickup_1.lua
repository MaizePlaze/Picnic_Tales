This is a full-featured, but simple pickup object that grants a resource to the player who collects it.

FEATURES
- Player animations for picking up the object (high and low variations).
- Visual and Sound effects.

USAGE
1. Drop into a game. Players walk up to the object and press [F] to collect it.
2. Can be spawned programatically, such as when an enemy is defeated.
3. The Trigger is set to be interactable. If that option is turned off, then this will be collected
   by walking over. The pickup animations still play when walking over.
4. By default it grants 10x Gold, which are both custom properties on the root of the template and can
   be customized. There is a 'ResourceMin' and 'ResourceMax' that define a random range.
5. Comes with two pickup animations that are used depending on how high the object is in relationship
   to the player. There is a high and a low pickup ability that get assigned to the player
   automatically on the first time they interact with a pickup. While the abilities are being created
   and assigned there is a small animation delay on the very first pickup.
6. Customizing the artwork and VFXs spin off into other pickup object types.
